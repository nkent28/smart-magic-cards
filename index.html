  <p class="text-white text-center py-4" id="description">
    A magician has a deck of cards, 52 cards, 13 of each suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades).<br>
    He will show us all of the cards and we will see that they are ordered and sorted by suit.<br>
    We are asked to shuffle the deck.<br>
    Then the magician askes to pick a single card.<br>
    When the magician reveals the deck of cards once more, the picked card is removed as well as all the related valued cards.<br>
    Eg. the 8 of hears it picked, now all the 8's are removed from the deck.

       so that when it's clicked it flips the cards as per the example browser. This doesn't work, I tried this also in the cards-wrapper div
       but it also didn't work. I'm not sure why this isn't working but would love feedback in a face to face interview.  -->

COMMENTS
The following parts of the test I've been unable to complete as I spent alot of time to get the other parts
of the code working and trying many different things:
Magic: Remove all related cards from the deck after picking a card. (Only display this button after a card has been picked).
[Have created a button for this]
Create the functionality to pick a card, by clicking on a random card.
When the trick is performed (by clicking the magic button), move the related cards to the picked card.
